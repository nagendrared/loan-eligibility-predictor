## 🧪 Installation & Setup

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+
- pip / npm

---

### 🔧 Backend Setup

# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Flask server
python app.py

Flask API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.


### 🎨 Frontend Setup

# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

**🌐 How It Works**
1. User enters loan-related details through a form.

2. Frontend sends a POST request to the Flask API.

3. Backend loads the trained model (model.pkl) and makes a prediction.

4. Result is returned and shown to the user in the interface.

## 📊 Model Details

- Model used: **Logistic Regression** (can be extended)
- Accuracy: ~75% on test data
- Trained using features like:
  - Gender
  - Married
  - Education
  - ApplicantIncome
  - CoapplicantIncome
  - Credit History
  - Loan Amount
  - Property Area

## 🚀 Deployment

This application is deployed with a **React + TypeScript frontend on Vercel** and a **Flask backend with ML model on Render**.

---

### 🔧 Backend Deployment (Render)

1. Push your `backend/` folder to a separate GitHub repo or subfolder.
2. Go to [https://render.com](https://render.com) and:
   - Click **"New Web Service"**
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Set the root directory to `backend/`
   - Choose **Python** environment
   - Set the **Start Command** as:
     ```bash
     gunicorn app:app
     ```
3. Add environment variables if needed.
4. Deploy! Render will provide you with a backend URL like: https://loan-eligibility-1-ibry.onrender.com/


---

### 🎨 Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push your `frontend/` folder to GitHub.
2. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and:
- Click **"New Project"**
- Import your repo and choose `frontend/` as the root
- Vercel auto-detects **Vite + React + TypeScript**
3. After build, your app is live at: https://loan-eligibility-predictor-five.vercel.app/


---

### 🌐 Connecting Frontend to Backend

In your frontend code (likely inside `api.ts` or `InputForm.tsx`), **replace the local Flask URL** with your deployed Render backend URL:

```ts
// Before (local)
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/predict", { ... })

// After (deployed)
const response = await fetch("https://loan-backend.onrender.com/predict", { ... })

```
